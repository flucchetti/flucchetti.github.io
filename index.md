## About Me

I am a third year Ph.D. candidate advised by [Arjun Guha](https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} at the [Programming Research Laboratory](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} of Northeastern University. My interests lie at the intersection of NLP, programming languages and systems. Specifically, I focus on
understanding how to use CodeLLMs safely in software applications, as well as training CodeLLMs for novel applications like low-resource programming languages. 

I base all my research on insights from *mechanistic interpretability*, or the view that model capabilities arise from
specific model components.
