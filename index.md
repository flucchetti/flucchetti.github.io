## About Me

I am a second year PhD student advised by [Arjun Guha](https://ccs.neu.edu/~arjunguha/main/home/){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} at the [Programming Research Laboratory](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} of Northeastern University. I am interested in the intersection of NLP, programming languages and systems. I work on aligning CodeLLMs with the goal of improving robustness and decreasing model size for resource constrained applications. Most recently, I worked on semi-synthetic data augmentation for improving the performance of CodeLLMs on low-resource programming languages. My research is based on mechanistic interpretability, or the view that capabilites of transformers arise from specific model components.

I received my Bachelor degree from Vassar College. I was advised by Luke Hunsberger and worked on Temporal Networks for planning.
